About my participation in the projects.

# CDR Data Optimization Project
## Overview  
This project successfully optimized the **storage and processing of Call Detail Record (CDR) data**, improving efficiency, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. Previously, the data was stored in an **Oracle Exadata on-premises environment**, requiring frequent infrastructure upgrades. The solution migrated the data to **Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW)** running on **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)**, leveraging **Parquet Snappy** and **CSV GZIP** compression for efficient long-term storage. The data was segmented following an **80-20 strategy**, where **20% remained in ADW for fast querying**, while **80% was stored externally in Object Storage**, ensuring optimized retrieval performance.  

## My Role in the Project  
I played a key role in analyzing and defining the architecture for storage optimization, ensuring a seamless transition to cloud-based infrastructure. I was responsible for:  
- **Assessing technical requirements** to improve performance and cost efficiency.  
- **Managing the ingestion pipeline** for handling **2TB of daily data**, ensuring stable and scalable operations.  
- **Optimizing query performance**, leveraging advanced compression and storage strategies to reduce retrieval times.  
- **Ensuring Alteryx compatibility**, providing efficient data access for analysis and business intelligence applications.  
- **Implementing Lifecycle Policies**, managing Object Storage to optimize data retention and retrieval.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW)**  
- **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)**  
- **Parquet Snappy & CSV GZIP Compression**  
- **Oracle Object Storage (Standard & Archive)**  
- **Alteryx**  
- **OCI CLI for Storage Management**  

## Project Success  
This initiative established a **scalable, cloud-based architecture for large-scale data processing**, reducing operational costs while enhancing data retrieval efficiency. The implementation improved **query performance**, **data lifecycle management**, and **scalability**, setting a new benchmark for enterprise-level data storage solutions.
